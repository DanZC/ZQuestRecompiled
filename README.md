# ZQuestRecompiled
A recompilation of ZQuest 1.92 beta 183 on modern PCs.

## Background
### What?
ZQuest or ZQuest Classic (previously known as Zelda Classic) is a game engine for classic 80's dungeon crawlers. It originally started out as a PC port of _The Legend of Zelda_ for the NES, but the project and feature set have grown substantially.

Games are made in the form of quests (.qst files). ZQuest comes with a quest editor that users can use to create quests. These quest files can be played by loading them up in the quest player.

### Why 1.92 beta 183?
1.92 (specifically its beta 183) is considered one of the most stable versions of ZQuest ever developed. Its feature set is considered a happy medium between limited and capable.

Unfortunately, 1.92 and older versions of ZQuest do not play nicely on newer versions of Windows or wine. These old versions of ZQuest were developed for MS-DOS, using an older version of Allegro. Even if you do manage to get them running, the low resolution makes them frustrating to use on modern displays.

### Can't ZQuest 2.53+ run older quests?
While the newest versions of ZQuest are mostly compatable with older quest files, there are some compatability bugs that break certain quests. There are also some graphical issues as well with older quests.

By recompiling 1.92, compatability with these older quests should be improved.
